1. Which register number is used for the stack pointer (sp) in OS/161?
	Register 29

2. What bus/busses does OS/161 support?
	Only bus supported for MIPS is LAMEbus

3. What is the difference between splhigh and sp10?
	splhigh sets the spl (set priority level) to the highest value and disables all interrupts
	sp10 set the spl to 0 and enables all interrupts

4. Why do we use typedefs like u_int32_t instead of simply saying "int"?
	We want to specify the size (32 bits) and that the number is unsigned

5. What does splx return?
	It returns the old interrupt state. splhigh and sp10 also return the old interrupt state.

6. What is the highest interrupt level?
	15

7. How frequently are hardclock interrupts generated?
	Either 10,000 per second or 100 per second. 100 is a more realistic value

8. What functions comprise the standard interface to a VFS device?
	vfs_setcurdir, vfs_clearcurdir, vfs_getcurdir, vfs_sync, vfs_getroot, vfs_getdevname, vfs_lookup, vfs_lookparent, vfs_open, vfs_readlink, vfs_symlink, vfs_mkdir, vfs_link, vfs_remove, vfs_rmdir, vfs_rename, vfs_chdir, vfs_getcwd, vfs_close, vfs_bootstrap, vfs_initbootfs, vfs_setbootfs, vfs_clearbootfs, vfs_adddev, vfs_addfs, vfs_mount, vfs_unmount, vfsunmountall

9. How many characters are allowed in a volume name?
	32

10. How many direct blocks does an SFS file have?
	15

11. What is the standard interface to a file system (i.e. what functions must you implement to implement a new file system)?
	vfs_setcurdir, vfs_clearcurdir, vfs_getcurdir, vfs_sync, vfs_getroot, vfs_getdevname, vfs_lookup, vfs_lookparent, vfs_open, vfs_readlink, vfs_symlink, vfs_mkdir, vfs_link, vfs_remove, vfs_rmdir, vfs_rename, vfs_chdir, vfs_getcwd, vfs_close, vfs_bootstrap, vfs_initbootfs, vfs_setbootfs, vfs_clearbootfs, vfs_adddev, vfs_addfs, vfs_mount, vfs_unmount, vfsunmountall

12. What function puts a thread to sleep?
	thread_sleep()

13. How large are OS/161 pids?
	32 bits

14. What operations can you do on vnode?
	vop_open, vop_close, vop_reclaim, vop_read, vop_readlink, vop_getdirentry, vop_write, vop_ioctl, vop_stat, vop_gettype, vop_tryseek, vop_fsync, vop_mmap, vop_truncate, vop_namefile, vop_creat, cop_symlink, vop_mkdir, vop_link, vop_remove, vor_rmdir, vop_rename, vop_lookup, vop_lookparent

15. What is the maximum path length in OS/161?
	1024

16. What is the system call number for a reboot?
	SYS_reboot = 8

17. Where is STDIN_FILENO defined?
	kern/include/kern/unistd.h

18. Is it OK to initialize the thread system before the scheduler? Why or why not?
	Yes. The scheduler bootstrap just creates the run queue, and the thread bootstrap initializes the first thread.

19. What is a Zombie?
	Zombies are thread/processes that have exited but not been fully deleted yet.

20. How large is the initial run queue?
	q_create(32)

21. What does a device name in OS/161 look like?
	name of device is device

22. What does a raw device name in OS/161 look like?
	the name with raw appended

23. What lock protects the vnode reference count?
	vn_countlock

24. What device types are currently supported?
	block and character devices
